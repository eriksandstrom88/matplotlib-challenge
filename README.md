In this study, I took two .csv files containing data on drug treatments tested on mice with tumors.  I combined the .csv files, cleaned the data, filtered the data, and created several visuals.

3 observations from processing the pymaceuticals data...

1)	Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most effective treatments of the four we isolated.  Their final tumor volume is drastically lower, as shown in the box plots, and their mean tumor volume is lower than all other treatments as seen in our summary statistics table.

2)	I isolated mouse a203, treated with Capomulin, and though Capomulin was one of the most promising treatments, tumor volume still grew over time.  Perhaps mouse a203 is a rare case of ineffective treatment, especially considering the final tumor volume for this mouse was well over the mean tumor volume for all mice treated with Capomulin.

3)	There is a reasonably strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin.  What we canâ€™t tell from the raw data is whether the mice weigh more because of the larger tumors, or whether larger mice tend to grow larger tumors.
